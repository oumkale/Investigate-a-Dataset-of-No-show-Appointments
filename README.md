# Investigate-a-Dataset-of-No-show-Appointments
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. ● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment. ● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital. ● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família. This study emphasized the need for more research for a better understanding of the problem. We made recommendations for prompting patients about their upcoming appointments, helping patients get transportation to healthcare facilities and making efforts to ensure better communication between the patients and the healthcare providers to understand the complex interplay between personal, systemic and financial(Scholarships) barriers in completing appointments.
